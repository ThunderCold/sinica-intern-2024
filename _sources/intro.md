# Introduction

> **Project Topic:<br>Use datapackage (v2) to describe LTSER field specifications and perform data quality validations**

This program validates the CSV dataset generated by the research and checks the correctness and accuracy of the data. The tools used are as follows:
- Python frictionless package: used to generate dataset specification and perform dataset verification.
- Python tkinter package: used to create user interfaces to facilitate users to operate various program functions.
- Google Gemini API: Use a large language model to generate the constraints values ​​of each field in the dataset.

After the program production is completed, data quality inspection will be performed on some datasets stored on the depositar by the LTSER Taiwan Program.
